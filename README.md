# 🧬 ESMNGly — Prediction Glycosylation Binding Site Model

ESMNGly is a deep learning-based tool that predicts **N-glycosylation binding sites** in proteins.  
Using advanced sequence embeddings from **PRETRAINED PROTEIN LANGUAGE MODEL-ESM-2(Evolutionary Scale Modelling)** and trained classification models, it helps researchers quickly identify potential glycosylation sites for further study.
